::threads
Creating threads

In Java, if you want to do more than one thing, you need a thread. The simplest case is just to subclass Thread and override the `run()` method. Then to start the thread, just instantiate a new instance and call `start()`.

``` java
public class HelloThread extends Thread {
	@Override
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello from a thread!");
	}
}

// start the thread
new HelloThread().start();
```
More flexible is just to implement the 'Runnable' interface.

``` java
public class HelloRunnable implements Runnable {

	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Hello from a runnable class!");
	}

}

// start a new thread with the runnable class
(new Thread(new HelloRunnable())).start();
``` 

A third choice is to use an [Executor](executor), which is similar to the above but can also provide scheduling, callbacks thread pooling and other goodies. 

``` java
new ThreadPoolExecutor(5, 10, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<Runnable>(10))
			.execute(new HelloRunnable());
```

::pausing
Pausing (sleeping) threads

If a thread has nothing to do, it can be paused by calling the `sleep()` method. The method throws an `InterruptedException` in case another thread needs to wake it from its sleep.

``` java
public class BackgroundThread extends Thread {

	@Override
	public void run() {
		while (true) {
			System.out.println(new Date());
			try {
				sleep(1000);
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
	}
}
```

::interrupting
Interrupting threads 

Other threads may interrupt at any time. Typically this signals that the thread should stop processing. There are two scenarios.

Interrupted Exception
---------------------
The thread has called a method that throws `InterruptedException`. This is the simple case, the thread merely catches the 
exception and decides what to do, which is usually just exit.

``` java
try {
	sleep(60*60*1000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
	// sleep has be interrupted
	return ;
}
```

Checking the interrupted flag
-----------------------------
If the thread is stuck in some heavy computation it should periodically check the status of the interrupt flag. 

``` java
for (int i : getInputs() ) {
    aBigCalculation(i);
    if (Thread.interrupted()) {
        // We've been interrupted: no more crunching.
        return;
    }
}
```
_Note_: It is often better just to convert this to an `InterruptedException`. 

``` java
if (Thread.interrupted()) {
    throw new InterruptedException();
}
```
