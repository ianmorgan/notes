Using Bourbon

[Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) is little difficult to integrate with Sinatra. There are 
some good notes at (http://koffeinfrei.heroku.com/2012/03/24/sinatra-with-bourbon). 

I found I needed to tweak this a little. My code block is 

``` ruby
get '/assets/css/:name.css' do |name|
  require './views/scss/bourbon/lib/bourbon.rb'
  content_type :css
  scss "scss/#{name}".to_sym, :layout => false
end
```
