::profile
Changing profile and shell  

First place to look is the profile file `~/.profile`
Not fully sure of rules, but basically this get loaded first and is not just for shell 

After that try your local bash startup `~/.bashrc`  or .bash_profile 

NOTE TO SELF!!! - I'm using oh-my-zsh -- and its all in `~/.zshrc`

::running_apps
Running applications 

To start from the command line 

```
> open -a "preview"
```

or using  full path 

```
> open /Applications/Netscape/netscape.app
```
